\chapter{Diderot Command Line Interface}

Diderot offers a command line interface to simplify interaction with
the platform via the command line.
%
The main advantage of the CLI over the web interface is that it is possible to upload materials onto the platform more quickly.

\begin{important}[Sources and Contributions]

%The CLI is available on AFS, at the following path: TODO (rohany): add the path in later.

To download the CLI, please clone 
%
\href{https://github.com/diderot-edu/diderot-cli}{this github repository}
%
and follow the instructions in \lstinline`README.md`. 

The Diderot CLI is public. Feel free to contribute or open an issue if there
are any commands or utilities that you think would be useful to have.
%
Please send feedback by 
\href{https://github.com/diderot-edu/diderot-cli/issues}{opening an issue}.

This guide is public and it source are available 
\href{https://github.com/diderot-edu/diderot-guide}{in this repo}.

\end{important}


\section{Basic Usage}

Use the \verb|diderot_student| or \verb|diderot_admin| scripts to interface with the CLI.
%
For help about the CLI, use the \verb|-h| or \verb|--help| commands.

\subsection{Credential Management}
Credentials are passed to the CLI in one of two ways. 
%
The first is to simply pass your credentials via the CLI using the \verb|--username| and \verb|--password| flags on the CLI. 
%
A more convenient (and recommended) way is to use a \emph{credentials file}.
%
The credential file format is simply a text file with your username on the first line and your password on the second. 
%
Use the \verb|--credentials| argument to point the CLI towards a file containing your credentials.
%
For easier usage, the CLI automatically looks at the files \verb|~/private/.diderot/credentials| and \verb|~/.diderot/credentials |for a credentials file of this form. 
%
If this file exists, then the CLI will automatically log you in, and no credentials need to be explicitly provided to the CLI.
%

\begin{important}
Your credentials file must have only "owner can read and write" permissions. 
%
You can  run \verb|chmod 600 <credentials file>| to set the appropriate permissions.
\end{important}

\begin{example}
An example credential file is below.
\begin{verbatim}
MyUsername
MyPassword
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

\begin{important}
If you are using a custom path (rather than the default path) for your credentials file, or passing your username and password explicitly, then you will need supply these arguments as the first in the command.
%
Specifically, the
%
\verb|--username|/\verb|--password| or \verb|--credentials| 
%
arguments must be passed to the CLI as the first argument, before
additional commands!

For example, this command is correct:
\begin{verbatim}
$ diderot_student --credentials Path/To/My/Creds list_courses
\end{verbatim}
  
This command is incorrect:
\begin{verbatim}
$ diderot_student list_courses --credentials Path/To/My/Creds
\end{verbatim}
\end{important}

\chapter{Diderot Command Line Interface}
\label{ch:cli}

Diderot offers a command line interface to simplify interaction with
the platform via the command line.
%
The CLI makes it possible to upload materials onto the platform more quickly than the GUI .

\begin{important}[Sources and Contributions]

%The CLI is available on AFS, at the following path: TODO (rohany): add the path in later.

To download the CLI, please clone 
%
\href{https://github.com/diderot-edu/diderot-cli}{this github repository}
%
and follow the instructions in \lstinline`README.md`. 

The Diderot CLI is public. Feel free to contribute or open an issue if there
are any commands or utilities that you think would be useful to have.
%
Please send feedback by 
\href{https://github.com/diderot-edu/diderot-cli/issues}{opening an issue}.

This guide is public and it source are available 
\href{https://github.com/diderot-edu/diderot-guide}{in this repo}.
%
Please send feeback by \href{https://github.com/diderot-edu/diderot-guide/issues}{opening an issue}.
\end{important}

\begin{important}
For most up to date information about the CLI commands, please use the
help mode of the CLI. For example if you type 

\begin{lstlisting}
$ diderot_admin
\end{lstlisting}

You can see the whole list of available commands.  You can then
request help for how to use a command by typing.
\begin{lstlisting}
$ diderot_admin <command name>
\end{lstlisting}

\end{important}

\section{Basic Usage}

Use the \verb|diderot_student| or \verb|diderot_admin| scripts to interface with the CLI.
%
For help about the CLI, use the \verb|-h| or \verb|--help| commands.

\subsection{Credential Management}
Credentials are passed to the CLI in one of two ways. 
%
The first is to simply pass your credentials via the CLI using the \verb|--username| and \verb|--password| flags on the CLI. 
%
A more convenient (and recommended) way is to use a \emph{credentials file}.
%
The credential file format is simply a text file with your username on the first line and your password on the second. 
%
Use the \verb|--credentials| argument to point the CLI towards a file containing your credentials.
%
For easier usage, the CLI automatically looks at the files \verb|~/private/.diderot/credentials| and \verb|~/.diderot/credentials |for a credentials file of this form. 
%
If this file exists, then the CLI will automatically log you in, and no credentials need to be explicitly provided to the CLI.
%

\begin{important}
Your credentials file must have only "owner can read and write" permissions. 
%
You can  run \verb|chmod 600 <credentials file>| to set the appropriate permissions.
\end{important}

\begin{example}
An example credential file is below.
\begin{verbatim}
MyUsername
MyPassword
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

\begin{important}
If you are using a custom path (rather than the default path) for your credentials file, or passing your username and password explicitly, then you will need supply these arguments as the first in the command.
%
Specifically, the
%
\verb|--username|/\verb|--password| or \verb|--credentials| 
%
arguments must be passed to the CLI as the first argument, before
additional commands!

For example, this command is correct:
\begin{verbatim}
$ diderot_student --credentials Path/To/My/Creds list_courses
\end{verbatim}
  
This command is incorrect:
\begin{verbatim}
$ diderot_student list_courses --credentials Path/To/My/Creds
\end{verbatim}
\end{important}

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Set Publish Date}
You can set the publish date for a book in two ways.
\begin{itemize}
\item Specify the date for publication using the format
  ``yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM'' For example, "2021-06-10T14:15'' means
  10$^{th}$ day of June in Year 2021 at 14:15 (2:15pm)
\item Specify a relative date by using ``W/D, HH:MM'' format.  For
  example, ``3/5, 14:15'' means means the fifth day of the third week
  at 14:15 (2:15pm) and ``11/3, 14:15'' means means the third day of
  the elevent week at 14:15 (2:15pm).  The days of the week are
  relative to the first day of the week that you have set in your
  course settings.  The weeks are also relative to the beginning day
  of your course date.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Uploading Chapters with a Makefile}

\begin{gram}
The user can use several simple Makefile rules to upload chapters onto
Diderot without.  To this end, the user will need to include
\verb|resources/makefile-upload-to-diderot| Makefile recipe in their
Makefile and then use rules that look like this
\begin{verbatim}
overview: overview/overview.xml overview/overview.pdf
upload_overview: NO=1
upload_overview: FILE=overview/overview
upload_overview: overview upload_xml_pdf
\end{verbatim}

Here the variable \verb|NO| specifies the chapter number and \verb|FILE| specifies the xml and pdf file names, assumed to be \verb|FILE.xml| and \verb|FILE.pdf| respectively.  
%
For a book chapter, the part can be specified using \verb|PART_NO| variable.
%
For attachments, the \verb|ATTACH| variable may be used.
%
The user can specify the course and the book being uploaded into by using the
\verb|LABEL_COURSE| and \verb|LABEL_TEXTBOOK| variables. 

Below is an example rule, where \verb|LABEL_COURSE| was set earlier in the Makefile.


\begin{verbatim}
upload_introduction_genome: TEXTBOOK="TB.VOL.1"
upload_introduction_genome: PART_NO=1 
upload_introduction_genome: NO=4
upload_introduction_genome: FILE=genome/genome
upload_introduction_genome: ATTACH=genome/media/*.jpg 
upload_introduction_genome: genome/genome.xml genome/genome.pdf upload_xml_pdf_attach
\end{verbatim}
\end{gram}

\begin{gram}[Example Makefile]
The \href{file://cli/attachments/Makefile-guide}{Makefile for the guide} uses this technique.

\end{gram}

\subsection{upload\_book}

\begin{gram}
\verb|upload_book| uploads a set of parts and chapters into a book or booklet.
%
It can be used to upload a complete booklet or book by creating all
the necessary parts and chapters specified in a json file.
%
It can also be used to upload any subset of parts and chapters.

It accepts two arguments.
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|course|: Course label that the book belongs to.
  \item \verb|book-data|: JSON file describing the parts and chapters to be uploaded (or the book/booklet).
\end{itemize}
\end{gram}

Example Usage:
\begin{verbatim}
diderot_admin upload_book  "CMU:Pittsburgh, PA:15210:Community:2020" volume-1.json
\end{verbatim}
%
 
\begin{gram}[JSON  for book uploads]
The JSON format required by book uploads is relatively self explanatory.
The file must specify the label of the book, the parts, and the chapters in the book. 
%
Each chapter field must contain \verb|number| specifying the chapter
number and and a \verb|part| number specifying the part for the chapter.

For each chapter, you can specify the content to upload in terms of
XML and PDF files.  To this end, use either the \lstinline{xml} or a
\lstinline{pdf} field, along with the file name that you would like to
upload into that chapter.
%
For an \lstinline{xml} chapter, you can optionally provide an
\lstinline{xml\_pdf} file, which is the PDF version of the chapter.
%
You can also provide attachments for the chapter, by using the
\lstinline{attachment} field along with a list of attachments.
%
If neither an xml or a pdf file is specified, then the chapter will be
created as an empty (retracted) chapter, along with the parts.


For each chapter you may specify a publication date by using
``publish_on_date'' or "publish_on_week" attributes.


\begin{itemize}
\item Using ``publish_on_date'', specify the date for publication
  using the format ``yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM'' For example,
  "2021-06-10T14:15'' means 10$^{th}$ day of June in Year 2021 at
  14:15 (2:15pm)
\item Using ``publish_on_week'', specify a relative date by using
  ``W/D, HH:MM'' format.  For example, ``3/5, 14:15'' means means the
  fifth day of the third week at 14:15 (2:15pm) and ``11/3, 14:15''
  means means the third day of the elevent week at 14:15 (2:15pm).
  The days of the week are relative to the first day of the week that
  you have set in your course settings.  The weeks are also relative
  to the beginning day of your course date.
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item Here is an example 
\href{file://cli/attachments/booklet-example.json}
{JSON file for a small book with only one part}.
\item Here is an example JSON file 
\href{file://cli/attachment/book-example.json}
{JSON file for a book}.
\end{itemize}

Each chapter field must contain \verb|number| specifying the chapter
number and in addition may contain any subset of \verb|xml|,
\verb|xml_pdf|, \verb|pdf|, \verb|title|, \verb|label|.  Note that for
\verb|xml| chapters, the label specified in the chapter takes
precedence over specified in the json file if any.

\end{gram}


\subsection{update\_assignment}

\verb|update_assignment| is used to update files related to an assignment on Diderot.
%
It accepts 6 arguments.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|course|: Course label that the assignment belongs to.
  \item \verb|homework|: Name of the assignment to update.
  \item \verb|--autograde-tar|: Optional path to the autograder tar file for the assignment. The autograde.tar file contains what is needed to run the assignment's autograder.
  \item \verb|--autograde-makefile|: Optional path to the autograde-Makefile for the assignment. The autograde-Makefile is used to execute the autograder on a student handin.
  \item \verb|--writeup|: Optional path to a PDF writeup of the assignment.
  \item \verb|--handout|: Optional path to a handout file that students can download to start the assignment.
\end{itemize}

Example Usage:
\begin{verbatim}
$ diderot_admin update_assignment courselabel homeworkname \
  --autograde-tar Path/To/Tar \
  --autograde-makefile Path/To/Makefile \
  --writeup Path/To/Writeup --handout Path/To/Handout
\end{verbatim}

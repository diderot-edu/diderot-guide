\chapter{Diderot Command Line Interface}

Diderot has a command line interface available to make interacting
with the platform a little easier if you prefer using the command
line instead of web UI's.

\begin{important}[Sources and Contributions]

The CLI is available on AFS, at the following path: TODO (rohany): add the path in later.

To download the CLI, please clone 
%
\href{https://github.com/diderot-edu/diderot-cli}{this github repository}
%
and follow the instructions in \lstinline`README.md`. 

The Diderot CLI is public. Feel free to contribute or open an issue if there
are any commands or utilities that you think would be useful to have. Please
send feedback about the CLI on Diderot.

\section{Basic Usage}

Run either \verb|d%iderot| or \verb|diderot_admin| and login with your Diderot credentials
to open an interactive shell with the commands below.
To exit, press \verb|Ctrl+D| or type \verb|exit| or \verb|quit|.
For a list of all available commands, type \verb|help|. To get more information
about a particular command, type either \verb|help <command>| or \verb|<command> -h|.

\section{Student Interface}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|list_courses|: List all available course labels.
    Operations which require a course input must use the one of the labels returned from this command.
  \item \verb|set_course|: Set the current target course for the CLI. All commands will now target the
    specified course rather than requiring a course as input.
  \item \verb|unset_course|: Removes the current set course. All course-specific commands
    will now require a course label as input.
  \item \verb|list_assignments|: Lists all assignments for a course.
  \item \verb|download_assignment|: Downloads all handout/writeup files (if present) from a
    target course and assignment into the current directory.
  \item \verb|submit_assignment|: Submit a handin.tar file to a given course and homework.
\end{itemize}

\section{Admin Interface}

The admin CLI contains all the above commands, and expands the set to include
some commands relating to manipulation of books and assignments.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|list_books|: List all books, can optionally filter by course.
  \item \verb|list_parts|: List all parts of a book.
  \item \verb|list_chapters|: List all chapters of a book.
  \item \verb|create_chapter|: Create a chapter in an input part of a book. Optionally specify
    the new chapter's label and or title. If not, these values are filled in with a default.
  \item \verb|update_book|: Update the content of an existing chapter. Upload either
    a standalone pdf, pdf of a slideshow, or an xml/mlx document and image attachments. 
    The image upload accepts filenames, globs, and folder names (folders are recursively traversed).
  \item \verb|update_assignment|: Update the files relating to an existing homework on Diderot.
    Upload any of the autograder tar, autograder makefile, pdf writeup, and student handout.
\end{itemize}

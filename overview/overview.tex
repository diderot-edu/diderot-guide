\chapter{An Overview of Diderot}
\label{ch:overview}

\begin{gram}
\label{ch:overview::intro}
Diderot is a relatively large system with many features. This guide presents a rough guide to some of these features.  Diderot is rapidly evolving, especially due to very high demand for new features and services. This guide is almost always out of date.
\end{gram}

\begin{gram}
\label{ch:overview::features}
At a high level, Diderot provides various features of online interactive books,  social networks, and LMSs (Learning Management Systems).
%
\textbf{The key idea behind Diderot is integration} and the goal is to
create one platform that provides all educational services required to
teach a university or school course.
%
Our experience so far shows that integration is a winner.
\begin{itemize}
\item Users like integration, because, for example, they don't have to juggle multiple systems.

\item Users are more productive, because everything is in one place and
  work well together. Users don't have waste time trying to
  integrate data from multiple different systems.

\item Integration creates many new capabilities that are otherwise
  difficult or impossible.  These new capabilities increase efficiency
  by automating complex educational tasks that currently require
  highly skilled human labor (e.g., teachers and professors).
  
\end{itemize}
%

Integration can also be complex. Diderot harnesses this complexity.

\begin{gram}[Features]
%
Specific features of Diderot include the following.

\begin{itemize}

\item  
\href{ch:dc}{Publication tools} 
%
for transforming traditional plain-text (LaTeX and Markdown) and PDF documents to interactive, online books. 

\item 
Access control: instructors can make an online book publicly
available or make them private, by giving access only to enrolled
students.

%% \item Community courses: a community server that allows anybody to register for a community course by supplying an instructor-specified email domain (e.g., \@...cmu.edu, \@...edu).
 
\item \href{ch:lms}{Course management tools} for managing student enrollment and grades.

\item An \href{ch:posts}{integrated communication subsystem} that support contextual Q
  \& A and discussions, and more generally several different forms of
  communication.
  
\item An \href{ch:quiz}{online exam and quiz system} with an integrated Q \& A and discussions.  

\item A cloud-based code submission system and autograder. Students
  can submit their code for grading on a cloud-based
  autograder. Instructors can choose effectively any amount of compute
  power, ranging from small machine instances to larger ones.

\item A \href{ch:cli}{command-line-interface} that can be used to
  perform many task from the command line, e.g., uploading content,
  submitting assignments.

\item
  Analytics subsystem that allows instructors to monitor user
  engagement.
  
\item  
  Cloud-based implementation that seamlessly scales and trivially
  deploys at any institution without requiring any onsite IT services.
\end{itemize}

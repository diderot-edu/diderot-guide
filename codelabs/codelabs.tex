\chapter{CodeLabs: A Cloud-Based Code Autograder}
\label{ch:codelabs}

Codelabs is a cloud-based code autograder.  To set it up, you will
need a Docker file for your grading environment.  That is pretty much
all.  In terms of the Autograder setup, CodeLabs is compatible with
Autolab and you can use your Autolab autograders and Make files as is.

The features of Codelabs include
\begin{itemize}
\item  
\textbf{manual grading:} allowing course staff to review code and leave comments and point
score on them,

\item
\textbf{regrade requests:} allowing students to create regrade
requests and course staff to respond to them

\item
  \textbf{submission management:} reviewing, rerunning/resubmitting submissions

\item
  \textbf{grade management:} viewing and downloading grades.
\end{itemize}

Please see the video above by Ria Pradeep of Carnegie Mellon University for a brief tutorial on Codelabs.

In addition to serving as a standalone auto-grader, codelabs, can also
be used to provide automatic feedback to the students.
%
In this ``chapter-grader'' mode, the CodeLab is coupled with a submittable
(quiz) chapter.
%
When a student makes a submission on the chapter, the (coupled) CodeLab is invoked with the answers of the student.

\section{Standalone Mode}
\label{sec:codelabs::standalone}

\begin{gram}[Autograder output format]
\label{sec:codelabs::standalone::output}

In the standalone mode, the autograder is expected to some output ending with a JSON string mappin problem names (as defined in the Grading tab) to the scores for that student, e.g.,
  
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  "scores":
  {"Shortest path": 5.0, "Longest path": 7.0, "Widest path": 15.0}
}
\end{lstlisting}
  
\end{gram}


\section{Chapter-Grader Mode}
\label{sec:codelabs::chapter}

\begin{gram}[Autograder output format]
\label{sec:codelabs::chapter::output}
  
In the chapter-grade mode, the JSON string should include additional information, including the rank for the problem (1, 2, 3, ...) and the total points available.  For example

\begin{lstlisting}
{"scores":
    {"1: Shortest path (10 pts)": 5.0,
     "2: Longest path (20 pts)": 7.0,
     "3: Widest path (30 pts)": 15.0,
 }}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{gram}

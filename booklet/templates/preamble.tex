  To submit the code portion of the assignment, run \sml{make package} and
  upload the resulting \sml{handin.tgz} to Diderot. You should ensure your code
  compiles by checking for a score of 0 under the \sml{Compilation} section on Diderot.
  Note that Diderot can take up to around 10 minutes to compile code submissions.

  Submit the written portion by uploading your \sml{written.pdf} to Gradescope.

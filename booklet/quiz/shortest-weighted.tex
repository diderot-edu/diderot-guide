\begin{problem}[5.][Shortest Weighted]

Given a graph with integer edge weights between $1$ and $5$
(inclusive), you want to find the shortest \emph{weighted} path
between a pair of vertices. 

\ask
How would you reduce this problem to the
shortest \emph{unweighted} path problem, which can be solved using
BFS?

\sol
Replace each edge with weight $i$ with a simple path of $i$ edges
each with weight $1$. Then solve with BFS.

\end{problem}

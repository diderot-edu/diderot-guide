\begin{problem}[6.][Star Contraction]
Select \textbf{every} type of graph listed below for which star
contraction will reduce the number of \textbf{edges} by a constant
factor in expectation in every round until fully reduced (and hence
imply $O(|E|)$ total work).  You can assume redundant edges between
vertices are removed.\\

\anychoice
\choice*  a graph in which all vertices have degree at most 2
\choice a graph in which all vertices have degree at most 3
\choice a graph in which all vertices have degree $\sqrt{|V|}$
\choice* a graph containing a single cycle (i.e. a forest with one additional edge)
\choice* the complete graph (i.e. an edge between every pair of vertices)
\choice any graph (still circle others if relevant)

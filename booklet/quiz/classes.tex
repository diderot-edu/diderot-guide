\begin{problem}[4.][Classes]

Lets say you are given a table that maps every student to the set of
classes they take.  

\ask

Fill in the algorithm below that returns all classes,
assuming there is at least one student in each class.  Your algorithm
must run in $O(m \log n)$ work and $O((\log m)(\log n))$ span, where
$n$ is the number of students and $m$ is the sum of the number of
classes taken across all students.    Note, our solution is one line.

\solfin

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
fun allClasses(T : classSet studentTable) : classSet = 
    ____ Table.reduce Set.union Set.empty T ____

\end{lstlisting}

\end{problem}

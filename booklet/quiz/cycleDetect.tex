\begin{problem}[4.][Parallel Cycle Detection]
\ask
Describe in words how you would as part of star contraction 
efficiently detect that an undirected graph has a cycle.  \textbf{No more than two sentences.}

\sol
If during star contraction we find any self edges not involved in
contraction itself then there is a cycle.   However,
we need to be careful not to remove duplicate edges, and only to
contract along a single duplicate edge.

%% -4 if claim detecting duplicate edges is sufficient.  It is not sufficient because you can contract duplicate edges at the same time\\
%% %
%% -2 if say detect self edge, but do not point out issue with duplicates.\\
%% %
%% 0 for DFS, BFS, etc.
